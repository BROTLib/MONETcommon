.SYNOPSIS
  Installs the vendored TcUnit library into the local TwinCAT library repository.

.DESCRIPTION
  MONETcommonTests references TcUnit as a placeholder ("TcUnit, * (www.tcunit.org)"), which only resolves if
  the library is installed in the machine's library repository. There is no command-line installer for a
  plain .library file (TcBuild's `install` only installs a PLC project as a library), so this drives XAE
  through its automation interface, the same call as Library Repository -> Install in the GUI.

  Run once per machine (and again after a TwinCAT reinstall). Needs TcXaeShell; no runtime, no license.
  It starts its own hidden XAE instance and always quits it: a stray TcXaeShell.exe left behind makes the
  next TcBuild run fail with exit code 1 (see BROTLib specs/plans/2026-09-15-twincat-ci-investigation.md).
